## Similarity Measures

The following similarity measures are included:

### Character based

Character-based distance measures compare strings on the character level. They are well suited for
handling typographical errors.

| Function and parameters | Name | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| jaro() | Jaro distance | String similarity based on the Jaro distance metric. |
| jaroWinkler() | Jaro-Winkler distance | String similarity based on the Jaro-Winkler distance measure. |

| substring([granularity: String = '3']) | SubString | Return 0 to 1 for strong similarity to weak similarity |

### Token based

While character-based distance measures work well for typographical errors, there are a number of tasks where token-base distance measures are better suited:

- Strings where parts are reordered e.g. &ldquo;John Doe&rdquo; and &ldquo;Doe, John&rdquo;
- Texts consisting of multiple words
