Extracts physical quantities, such as length or weight values.
Values are expected of the form '{Number}{UnitPrefix}{Symbol}' and are converted to the base unit.

Example:

- Given a value '10km, 3mg'.
- If the symbol parameter is set to 'm', the extracted value is 10000.
- If the symbol parameter is set to 'g', the extracted value is 0.001.
