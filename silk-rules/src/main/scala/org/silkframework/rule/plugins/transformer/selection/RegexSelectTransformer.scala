/**
  * This transformer takes 3 inputs.
  * The first input should have exactly one value that should be passed out again untouched.
  * The second input has at least two Regex values - two in order to make sense.
  * The third input should have exactly one value which is checked against the regexes.
  *
  * The result of the transformer is a sequence with the same length of number of regexes.
  * For the output value (of the first input) is set to each position in this sequence where
  * the related regex also matched.
  *
  * Example:
  *
  * For inputs
  * {{{
  *   Seq(
  *     Seq("output"),
  *     Seq("a", "b", "c"),
  *     Seq("catch")
  *   )
  * }}}
  *
  * the transofmer will return
  * {{{
