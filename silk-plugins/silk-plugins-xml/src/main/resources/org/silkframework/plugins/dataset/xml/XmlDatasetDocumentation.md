Typically, this dataset is used to transform an XML file to another format, e.g., to RDF.
When this dataset is used as an input for another task (e.g., a transformation task), the input type of the consuming task selects the path where the entities to be read are located.

Example:

    <Persons>
      <Person>
        <Name>John Doe</Name>
        <Year>1970</Year>
      </Person>
      <Person>
        <Name>Max Power</Name>
        <Year>1980</Year>
      </Person>
    </Persons>

A transformation for reading all persons of the above XML would set the input type to `/Person`.
The transformation iterates all entities matching the given input path.
In the above example the first entity to be read is:

    <Person>
      <Name>John Doe</Name>
      <Year>1970</Year>
    </Person>

All paths used in the consuming task are relative to this, e.g., the person name can be addressed with the path `/Name`.

Path examples:

- The empty path selects the root element.
- `/Person` selects all persons.
- `/Person[Year = "1970"]` selects all persons which are born in 1970.
- `/#id` Is a special syntax for generating an id for a selected element. It can be used in URI patterns for entities which do not provide an identifier. Examples: `http://example.org/{#id}` or `http://example.org/{/pathToEntity/#id}`.
- The wildcard * enumerates all direct children, e.g., `/Persons/*/Name`.
- The wildcard ** enumerates all direct and indirect children.
- The backslash can be used to navigate to the parent XML node, e.g., `\Persons/SomeHeader`.
- `#text` retrieves the text of the selected node.
