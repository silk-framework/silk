This stop word list filter uses the following
[list of English stop words](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/rg089/35e00abf8941d72d419224cfd5b5925d/raw/12d899b70156fd0041fa9778d657330b024b959c/stopwords.txt)
as a default.

The removal of stop words is case-insensitive. For example, 'The' and 'the' are considered the same.

Should you want to provide your own stop word list, either as a resource (e.g. a file) or a remote URL, see the filters
'removeStopWords' and 'removeRemoteStopWords'.
